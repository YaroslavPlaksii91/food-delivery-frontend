## Project Description

The Food Delivery website is an online platform that allows users to order food from various restaurants and have it delivered to their doorstep. It provides a convenient and easy way for users to browse through different restaurants, view their menus, place orders, and track the delivery status.

The project is built using modern web technologies such as React, Next.js, and Node.js. It utilizes APIs to fetch restaurant data and track deliveries.

## Features

- Restaurant browsing: Users can browse through a list of available restaurants, view their menus, and read reviews.
- Menu customization: Users can customize their orders by selecting items from the menu, specifying special instructions, and adding items to the cart.
- Order placement: Users can place orders for food items, enter delivery details, and make order.
- Order tracking: Users can track the status of their orders in real-time, from preparation to delivery.

## Pages

The Food Delivery app consists of two pages:

1. **Shops Page**: This page allows users to choose a shop from the available options. Users can browse through different restaurants, view their menus, and select items to add to the cart. The data for the shops and menu items is fetched from the database.

2. **Shopping Cart Page**: This page displays the user's shopping cart, where they can review the added products, remove items, change the quantity, and provide additional information such as email, phone number, and address using input fields. The user can submit the order, and it will be saved in the database. Users can only order products from one shop, and the selection of other shops should be disabled.
